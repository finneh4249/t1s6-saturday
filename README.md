# Python Term 1 Week 6 Saturday Class

## If-Else Practice Activiy

### Building a Calculator ([calculator.py](calculator.py))

Build a calculator that takes 3 inputs from the user:
2 inputs as numbers (floats) for operation and 3rd input to decide which operation they want to perform.

## Lists [list_example.py](list_example.py)

Composite data type, meaning multiple data types can be stored in one variable.
Each piece is called an element.

## Loops

Like Post Malone describes, "Run Away, but we're running in circles"
Used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met.

DRY Coding Principle: Don't Repeat Yourself

Example: Counting coins in your piggy bank.

'If' conditionos would decide whether or not to run the intended block whereas, loops would decide how many times the block should be run.

### While Loop ([while_loop.py](while_loop.py))

While the condition is met, the intended block of code is executed.

Things to consider:

    - Program can enter the loop
    - Program can exit the loop

Example: [guessing_game.py](guessing_game.py)

### For Loop ([for_loop.py](for_loop.py))

For each item in a sequence, execute the intended steps.

#### Range

It's a predefined function that generates a sequence of numbers.
Useful:

- Loops for iterating a specific number of times over a sequence of numbers
`range(start, stop, step)`

`range(1, 2, 3)`

#### Practice Example 1 ([sum_of_first_ten_numbers.py](sum_of_first_ten_numbers.py))

Finding the sum of the first 10 numbers. (1,2, ..., 10)

#### Practice Example 2 ([largest_number.py](largest_number.py))

Find the largest number in the list

### Loop Control Statements

Used to control the flow of the program. Terminate the loop early if you want, or skip over some iteration.

#### Break and Continue ([break_continue.py](break_continue.py))

##### Break

Used to break out of a loop.

##### Continue

Used to skip an iteration and moves to the next iteration.

### Nested Loops

A loop inside another loop! Inception.
Useful for running over multi-dimensional structures, like MATRIX.

#### Practice Example 1

Create a right angled triangle with *

## Enumerate Function
