# Python Term 1 Week 6 Saturday Class

## If-Else Practice Activiy

### Building a Calculator ([calculator.py](calculator.py))

Build a calculator that takes 3 inputs from the user:
2 inputs as numbers (floats) for operation and 3rd input to decide which operation they want to perform.

## Lists [list_example.py](list_example.py)

Composite data type, meaning multiple data types can be stored in one variable.
Each piece is called an element.

## Loops

Like Post Malone describes, "Run Away, but we're running in circles"
Used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met.

DRY Coding Principle: Don't Repeat Yourself

Example: Counting coins in your piggy bank.

'If' conditionos would decide whether or not to run the intended block whereas, loops would decide how many times the block should be run.

### While Loop ([while_loop.py](while_loop.py))

While the condition is met, the intended block of code is executed.

Things to consider:

    - Program can enter the loop
    - Program can exit the loop

Example: [guessing_game.py](guessing_game.py)

### For Loop ([for_loop.py](for_loop.py))
